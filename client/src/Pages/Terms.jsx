            </h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              LOBBY is a <strong>directory service</strong> that connects independent drivers with potential passengers. We are not a transportation carrier.

              <strong>Key Distinction:</strong> We do not employ drivers. The contract for transportation is directly between the Rider and the Driver. LOBBY is not a party to that agreement.
